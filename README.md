# Mount Olympus Framework

A suite of AI-powered tools and applications, each inspired by the gods, built to make software automation, deployment, and market intelligence accessible to everyone.  

**Vision:**  
Mount Olympus is more than just a collection of apps. It’s a framework for:  
- 🚀 Automating development and deployment (Daedalus)  
- 📈 Detecting manipulation in financial, collectible, and betting markets (Athena, Nike, Hermes)  
- 🧠 Pattern recognition and behavioral analysis (Cerberus)  
- 🎭 Media intelligence and underground streaming (Hades)  
- 👁 Early-warning risk detection and monitoring (Argus)  

Together, these tools give developers, creators, and analysts the same edge as hedge funds, insiders, and power users — but in a way that’s **AI-driven, modular, and intuitive.**
